# Archivist

I've opted to post the base keylogger without command and control functionality in the main repo. These are being worked on. The completed design will have C2 functionality through two seperate third party services a handler and complimentary exploits.

The development files for those and more can be found in the **Beta** directory. Please click [here](https://github.com/NullArray/Archivist/tree/master/Beta) for details.
